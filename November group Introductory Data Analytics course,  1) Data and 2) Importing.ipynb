Swimming Canada is the official body that oversees competitive swimming there, inclusive of diving, synchronized swimming, and open water swimming. Canada first participated in the London Olympic Games in 1908. One of the country's swimming traditions is the \"polar bear plunge\", one that sometimes whole families take part in during New Year's Day. Other variations are the \"polar bear dip\" and the \"polar bear swim\", which are also celebrated in wintertime across many parts of the northern country. \n",

      "10. France, 27 Titles \n",
      "France has grabbed a total of 27 Titles in competitive swimming since it first participated in international level swimming and the Summer Olympic Games. All competitive swimming in France, including diving, synchronized swimming, and open water swimming, are overseen by the French Swimming Federation. Public swimming in France just got weirder recently, with swimming pool rules prohibiting men from wearing anything in the pool but tight, Speedo-style swimwear. Reasons behind this restriction is the thought that some men wear their shorts from home to public pools and get them dirty. \"Wild swimming\" in France is also a favorite activity, and one that is said to be similar to cliff diving in Mexico. The most sought after places to go for wild plunges are the pristine crater lakes of the Masif Central, the hot springs of the Pyrenees, and the emerald pools of Provence. \n",

Swimming in the frigid waters of the Danube River during the holiday season is a traditional activity for fun-seeking Hungarians. Hungarian swimmers in the Summer Olympics also have a tradition to keep, as the country has won more swimming golds at home than any other that has hosted an Olympics. \n",

The next Olympics in 1972 saw both nations once again compete separately, and they were officially listed as two nations. In 1990, after the reunification of the east and west, only the Federal Republic of Germany existed. Today, Germany competes as one nation in all international athletic events.
